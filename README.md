TeraSim is the first simulation platform for THz communication networks which captures the capabilities of THz devices and the peculiarities of the THz channel. The simulator has been developed considering two major types of application scenarios, namely, nanoscale communication networks (average transmission range usually below one meter) and macroscale communication networks (distances larger than one meter). The simulator consists of a common channel module, separate physical and link layers for each scenario, and two assisting modules, namely, THz antenna module and energy harvesting module, originally designed for the macroscale and nanoscale scenario, respectively. TeraSim is expected to enable the networking community to test THz networking protocols without having to delve into the channel and physical layers.
